        <br>
        <p class="introduction" class="leftmargin">As an avid fan of the <span class="italics">Harry Potter</span> series, I grew up reading the books. Whenever my family went out to eat, we loved to quiz each other on <span class="italics">Harry Potter</span> trivia while we waited for our food. On long road trips, we would listen to Jim Dale narrarate the series. I was soon introduced to the movies, and was a little dissapointed by how the story was portrayed. Below I have a list of reasons why reading the books would be a better use of your time to get a better story than to watch the movies.</p>

        <ol class="leftmargin">
            <li id="plot" class="ListHeading">Crucial Plot Points
                <ul>
                    <li>As a classic scene to show the difference between the books and the movies, we see that interpretations of the characters and the plot points are <span class="emphasis">wildly different</span>.</li>
                    <li>As shown in the youtube video above, the greatest character that suffered was Albus Dumbledore. Rather than being a sage mentor to Harry, he seems more annoyed with him.</li>
                    <li>It may not seem like much at first, but this is actually a crucial plot point; Dumbledore <span class="emphasis">loved</span> Harry. This is much more apparent in the books. The reason why we have the story is because Dumbledore got too attached to Harry and couldn't let him face his destiny.</li>
                    <li>In another crucial scene at the end of <span class="normal">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</span> in the youtube video, we see that Harry simply <span class="emphasis">breaks</span> the Elder Wand and is done with it.</li>
                    <li>In the books, however, he decides that the wand should go back to its former owner - Albus Dumbledore.</li>
                    <li>To me, this showed further restraint and nobility. It also symbolized the trust that he placed in Dumbledore. While both portray this as a herioc and selfless act, the book shows this as Harry following in the footsteps of his mentor.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li id="char" class="ListHeading">Bland Characters
                <ul>
                    <li>In the movies, Harry Potter is portrayed as a <span class="emphasis">whiny</span> teenager. Specifically, the sixth book (<span class="normal">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</span>) the plot is centered around Harry's love life (which to be honest, wasn't doing a whole lot in the book either). With this shift in focus, we get less of a protaganist understanding his motivation to vanquish the antagonist and more of a love drama.</li>
                    <li>While Harry is still a teenager in the books and still has some whining, we get to see his thought process more. This might just be the nature of books, but one can resonate more with the character and more fully understand why he does what he does.</li>
                    <li>Some other side characters that are worse in the movies are Ginny Weasely and Bellatrix LeStrange.</li>
                    <li>First, Ginny Weasely is used as the love interest far more than is necessary. There are many scenes that, to heighten Harry's motive to protect others, Ginny is used as the apple of his eye. As discussed earlier, there was an entire book dedicated to Harry's motive. With that knowledge, these scenes simply seem nothing less than weird.</li>
                    <li>Second, Bellatrix LeStrange while a memorable character in the movie was much more formidable in the books. In the movies, she's simply a lunatic (rather strange, badum-tsh). In the books, she's more crafty and "professional".</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li id="good" class="ListHeading">Some Good Things
                <p class="paragraph">Even though I would still prefer reading the books to watching the movies, I can still see the merit in adapting this beloved story to the screen.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <span class="emphasis">special effects</span> are stunning and really do bring the magic to life.</li>
                    <li>The layout of <span class="emphasis">Hogwarts</span> castle and the grounds is beautiful, which you don't get to visualize fully in the books.</li>
                    <li>Again, <span class="emphasis">spoiler warning</span>; the way that <span class="emphasis">Hedwig</span> dies is much more heroic. In the book, her death is more of an accident when Harry travelling to safety. In the movies, she dies protecting Harry from a Killing curse. I would have to agree that it is a much better way for that character to leave.</li>
                </ul>
